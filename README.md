# STEP Deep Learning - Practical Module

Welcome to the repository for the practical component of the Deep Learning class at STEP.  
This repository complements the theoretical content and supports hands-on experimentation with various deep learning techniques applied to image data.

## Overview

This repository includes a sequence of Jupyter Notebooks designed to guide students from the deployment of pretrained models to the training of custom networks and problem-solving challenges. The notebooks are organized to follow the structure of the practical sessions.

## üìÅ Notebooks

### 1. `Deploy_classification_model.ipynb`
**Topic:** Image Classification with Pretrained Models  
This notebook demonstrates how to use pretrained deep learning models (such as VGG, ResNet, etc.) to perform image classification on new data.  
Focus is placed on model deployment, prediction, and interpretation of outputs.

### 2. `Identification&Segmentation_YOLO.ipynb`
**Topic:** Object Detection and Segmentation  
In this notebook, we explore the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture for identifying and segmenting objects within images.  
Students will learn how bounding boxes and object labels are generated and interpreted.

### 3. `Classification_CIFAR_10.ipynb`
**Topic:** Training a Custom Classifier  
This example walks through the process of training a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
It covers dataset preparation, model architecture definition, training, validation, and performance evaluation.

### 4. `Challenges.ipynb`
**Topic:** Practical Deep Learning Challenges  
This notebook contains a series of open-ended challenges that encourage students to apply the knowledge gained during the practical sessions.  
The challenges are designed to test problem-solving and model adaptation skills.
